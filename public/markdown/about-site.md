# About This Site

This site is inspired by macOS [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/), developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Some of the icons are generated using [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).

The source code of this version is hosted [here](https://github.com/sayuru-akash/resume-playground).

All credits of the development goes to [Renovamen](https://github.com/Renovamen/) who created the original version of this site which is hosted [here](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos).
